granted herein to Spectral Lab and recipients of software distributed by Spectral
Lab, You reserve all rights, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

## 1. Definitions

**"You" (or "Your")** shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized
by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Spectral Lab.  
For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that
control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are
considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition,
"control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or
management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership
of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial
ownership of such entity.

**"Contribution"** shall mean the code, documentation, or other original works
of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work,
that is submitted by You to Spectral Lab for inclusion in, or documentation of,
any of the projects owned or managed by Spectral Lab (the "Work"). For the
purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal,
or written communication sent to Spectral Lab or its representatives, including
(but not limited to) communication on mailing lists, source code control systems,
and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Spectral Lab
for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication
that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as
"Not a Contribution."

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to
Spectral Lab, and to recipients of software distributed by Spectral Lab, a
perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
copyright license to:

- reproduce,
- prepare derivative works of,
- publicly display,
- publicly perform,

## 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to
Spectral Lab and to recipients of software distributed by Spectral Lab a
perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use,
offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license
applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily
infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your
Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or
contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that
entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of
the date such litigation is filed.

You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. You
represent further that each of Your employees is authorized to submit
Contributions on Your behalf, unless explicitly designated in writing as
"Not authorized to submit Contributions on behalf of (name of corporation)."

## 4. Contributions

You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation.

Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may
submit it to Spectral Lab separately from any Contribution, identifying the
complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction
(including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license
agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the
work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: (named here)".

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the
extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a
fee, or not at all.

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your
Contributions on an **"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
KIND**, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties
or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

## 5. Licensing Model

All Contributions are integrated into the Work under a **dual license**:

- **GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL-3.0-or-later)** for community use,
- **Spectral Lab Commercial License** for proprietary use by Spectral Lab
  in its products and services, in order to ensure the long-term sustainability
  of the non-profit association that manages the project.
