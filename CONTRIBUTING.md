# Contributing to Spectral Lab Projects

Thank you for your interest in contributing!  
To protect both contributors and maintainers, and to ensure the long-term sustainability of the project, all contributions are subject to the following rules.

---

## Contributor License Agreement and Developer Certificate of Origin

Depending on the project you contribute to:

- **Markdown-Import (MIT license)**  
  - Contributions are accepted under the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](docs/legal/developer_certificate_of_origin.md).  
  - By contributing, you certify that you have the right to submit your code and that you agree to its redistribution under the MIT license.

- **All other Spectral Lab projects (Preparo, Refero, AutomaticBook suite, BookCreator, Superscript, Inspectora, etc.)**  
  - Contributions are accepted only with a formal agreement:  
    - [ICLA (Individual Contributor License Agreement)](docs/legal/individual_contributor_license_agreement.md) if you contribute as an individual.  
    - [CCLA (Corporate Contributor License Agreement)](docs/legal/corporate_contributor_license_agreement.md) if you contribute on behalf of a company.  
  - These contributions are published under the **AGPL v3** license (strong copyleft) to guarantee that all modifications remain free.  
  - In some cases (Spectral Cloud), code is integrated into **proprietary components**:  
    - By contributing, you agree that Spectral Lab may reuse your contribution in its commercial products.  
    - Revenues from these products help **sustain the non-profit association** that maintains the project and ensure the continuity of free development.

Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Spectral Lab, all contributions fall under this framework.
