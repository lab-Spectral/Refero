# Refero
Refero is a modern and intuitive web client for managing Zotero libraries. It offers a sleek, responsive user interface that enables researchers, students, and professionals to efficiently manage their reference collections. Unlike existing solutions, Refero stands out through its advanced customization capabilities: users can enable or disable desired fields and item types, and add custom fields stored in Zotero’s “extra” field—offering unmatched flexibility for specialized workflows.

The project is built with Svelte (a modern JavaScript framework) and Vite (a fast build tool) to ensure optimal performance. Its modular three-pane interface provides full integration with the Zotero Web API.

Refero represents a significant modernization of the Zotero experience, combining technical performance with ease of use to meet the evolving needs of academic research. As the most customizable Zotero client available, it transforms how researchers interact with their bibliographic references, seamlessly adapting to their working methods.
